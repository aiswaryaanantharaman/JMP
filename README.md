Practice data manipulation and visualization using JMP software

JMP (pronounced "jump") is a suite of computer programs for statistical analysis developed by JMP, a subsidiary of SAS Institute. 
It was launched in 1989 to take advantage of the graphical user interface introduced by the Macintosh operating systems.
It has since been significantly rewritten and made available also for the Windows operating system.
JMP is used in applications such as Six Sigma, quality control, and engineering, design of experiments, 
as well as for research in science, engineering, and social sciences.

Using JMP, I imported a dataset from Kaggle, manipulated the data to draw insights. JMP also helps visualize data.

Dataset used:
120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results
athlete_events.csv
